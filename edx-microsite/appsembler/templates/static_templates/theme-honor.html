<p>&nbsp;<strong>4. Subscriptions including a FT subscription</strong></p>
<p>This section only applies if you have purchased a subscription to the Content that includes a FT.com subscription as part of the offer. In this instance we will aim to process your FT.com standard digital subscription (the &ldquo;<strong>FT Subscription</strong>&rdquo;) promptly but we do not guarantee that your subscription will be activated by any specified time.&nbsp; The FT Subscription is published by The Financial Times Limited and will expire after the agreed time once activated.&nbsp; You must accept the FT.com <a href="http://help.ft.com/tools-services/ft-com-terms-and-conditions/">terms and conditions</a>, <a href="http://help.ft.com/tools-services/financial-times-privacy-policy/">privacy policy</a> and <a href="http://help.ft.com/tools-services/how-the-ft-manages-cookies-on-its-websites/">cookie policy</a> in order to access the FT Subscription and each time you access the FT Subscription you are confirming your agreement to those terms, conditions and policies.</p>
<p>In addition, where you have enrolled in a course or purchased a subscription to the Content you may receive exclusive offers to FT Live events operated by The Financial Times Limited.&nbsp; Any such offers are subject to change from time to time at our or The Financial Times Limited&rsquo;s discretion and are subject to FT Live&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ft-live.com/terms-and-conditions">terms and conditions</a> in force from time to time.</p>
<p>You agree we may share your personal data with The Financial Times Limited and Pearson Education Inc. for these purposes.

<p>&nbsp;<strong>5.&nbsp; Renewals and Cancellation for Subscriptions</strong></p>
<p>We may offer different payment terms for your subscription to the Content and different lengths of subscription (such as annual subscriptions or monthly subscriptions) which will be made clear to you when you subscribe.&nbsp; For annual subscriptions, we will notify you of the pending renewal of your subscription at least 30 days prior to the date your subscription renews, except as otherwise required by law. Unless you notify us before the end of your annual subscription period that you no longer wish to receive it, your annual subscription will renew for another year. For monthly subscriptions, your subscription will continue from month to month until you notify us that you no longer wish to receive it. The cancellation of your monthly subscription will become effective at the end of your then current monthly subscription period.</p>
<p>We will charge the subscription using the same card or other payment method that you previously used.&nbsp; We will tell you in advance of any increase in the price of your subscription and offer you an opportunity to cancel it if you do not wish to pay the new price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By placing your order you agree that we may start your subscription immediately upon our accepting your order. This means that you are not entitled to a refund if you change your mind after we have provided you with access to your subscription.</p>
<p>Except as set out in the previous section, you do not have any right to cancel your subscription or any part of it until the end of your then current subscription period. Although you may notify us of your intention to cancel at any time, such notice will only take effect at the end of your then current subscription period, and you will not receive a refund (except in the limited circumstances set out in these terms).</p>
<p>You may notify us of your wish to cancel your subscription by contacting our Customer Services team at <a href="mailto:customerservice@NYIF.com">customerservice@NYIF.com</a> or alternatively, call +1 212 641 6616.</p>

We may also suspend or terminate your subscription or your access to the Content if we are prevented from providing services and the Content to you by circumstances beyond our control. If we terminate your subscription or your access to the Content due to circumstances beyond our control and/or permanently cease publishing the Content or cease to provide subscription services then, unless there are exceptional circumstances, we will provide you with a pro rata refund to your credit card. This means that we will refund you with any amounts that you have paid us in advance that relate to any remaining and unexpired period of your subscription.</p>
