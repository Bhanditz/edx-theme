            <h3>Choice</h3>

            <p>When hiring employees Aquent must collect and transfer Personal Data in order to comply with statutes, rules and regulations pertaining to employment.

Any such transfers will be solely for the purposes of fulfilling Aquent’s obligations to its employees, such as payroll and insurance.   Concerned individuals may withhold consent to such transfers and will be informed of the impact such opt-out will have on their employment within Aquent (ex. inability to process benefits or payroll data in a timely or appropriate fashion).</p>

            <p>Individuals may “opt out” of having their Personal Data used in Aquent promotions by emailing <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@aquent.com" target="_blank" title="unsubscribe@aquent.com">unsubscribe@aquent.com</a>.</p>

            <h3>Data Integrity</h3>

            <p>Individuals must immediately update their data when and if it changes so that Aquent can maintain accurate data about them.  Individuals may contact Aquent to update the content and accuracy of their information. Registered users of the Aquent website have access to their individual information and may update or correct it at any time.  Although individuals may change their data, Aquent may retain in backup or inactive files the uncorrected or outdated data. Such data may be retained for several reasons, including backups for disaster recovery planning, dispute resolution purposes, troubleshooting, and enforcement of agreements. Therefore, individuals should not expect that all of their historical data will be removed from our databases at the time they notify us of changes.   Aquent reserves the right to correct Personal Data to make it current and consistent with data directly provided by individuals -- for example, when they update their address on their resume but not elsewhere.</p>

            <h3>Security</h3>

            <p>Aquent takes reasonable security measures such as password protection, encryption, physical locks, etc. as it deems appropriate to protect the information it collects from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.  Employees authorized to access Personal Data of others are required to take the appropriate safe guards to protect the Personal Data.  Some information gathered on the Aquent website is encrypted and protected with secure socket layer (SSL) encryption. Where Aquent deems encryption unnecessary, website users are so informed.  Only the individual user and Aquent personnel (solely on a need-to-know basis) have access to such information. All information collected from website users by Aquent is stored on servers hosted in a physically secure environment. Questions about the security of the website should be directed to <a href="mailto:questions@aquent.com" target="_blank" title="questions@aquent.com">questions@aquent.com</a>. Notwithstanding the foregoing, users should keep in mind that the website and the Aquent services are run on software, hardware, and networks, any component of which may, from time to time, require maintenance or experience problems or breaches of security. Website users are required to keep their Aquent passwords confidential. Aquent is not responsible for misuse of passwords. Users should advise Aquent immediately if they believe their passwords have been compromised. </p>

            <h3>Enforcement</h3>

Aquent encourages interested individuals to raise any concerns using the contact information provided and Aquent will investigate and attempt to resolve any complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of Personal Data.  For complaints that cannot be resolved between Aquent and the complainant, Aquent has agreed to participate in the dispute resolution procedures of the panel established by the European data protection authorities to resolve disputes pursuant to the Safe Harbor Principles.</p>

            <h3>Amendments</h3>

            <p>This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time consistent with the requirements of the Safe Harbor. Aquent will post any revised policy on this website.
