        <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <div class="landing-additional-text__separator"></div>
          <p>BodyMind Institute Founder, Lars Gustafsson recalls: In 2008, it was on one of my many, many personal trips into the Canadian Rocky Mountains, that I suddenly realized:</p>
          <p><i>"Everything that I have been learning and preparing for, in creating online learning for the BodyMind Nutrition certifications, is actually meant to be in support of a much more broad holistic education vision!"</i>
          <p>I clearly remember what it felt like to realize that, everything I had been preparing for, was intended to support the brilliant professional instructors (which I would later meet).  In those special personal moments in the mountains, I was enthralled, and I couldn’t wait to take this Canadian Rocky Mountain vision to our BodyMind advisory board. At that time, I had the incredible privilege, honor, and pleasure to retain an advisory board group with 17 of the most generous and intelligent doctors, business and life coaches, and wellness experts.  In one of our quarterly meetings, this group unanimously agreed to establish a holistic education institute.  This organization could carry each of the condensed principles of actionable education, into the many courses our collective of professional instructors could create.  We all held the vision that, together, the BodyMind holistic instructors and the students who seek them out could raise the vibration of the human spirit, and better life for individuals and their offline communities.  Holistic education really took the spotlight at this exciting meeting!</p>
