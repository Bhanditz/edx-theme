      <h2>You're almost there!</h2>
      <p>We're really thrilled that you made it this far throug the class.  At this point, you got a {{score}} - and to pass you need to get greater than an 80.  </p>

      <p><strong>Lucky for you</strong> you've still got another try left on the exam. If you're able to take it again and pass, you'll recieve an official certification.</p>

      <p>This is a great time to go back and review the course material.  Take a look at things you may have struggled with, and have another go at the exam when you feel prepared.  Good luck!</p>
